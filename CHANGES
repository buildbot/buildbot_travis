Changelog
=========

0.0.15 (2012-11-01)
-------------------

- Now fully support the ``matrix`` options allowing finer control over the
  implied matrix generated from the list of runtimes and environment
  variables::

      python:
        - 2.6
        - 2.7
      env:
        - FLAVOUR=apple
        - FLAVOUR=orange
      matrix:
        exclude:
          - python: 2.7
            env: FLAVOUR=orange
        include:
          - python: 2.7
            env: FLAVOUR=banana

  This will do an additional build of the ``banana`` build but only for python
  2.7. And it will turn off the build for the ``orange`` flavour, again only
  for python 2.7.

- Mail notification can't send a change notification if it doesn't have
  anything to compare to (to detect the change). So it doesn't try to.
